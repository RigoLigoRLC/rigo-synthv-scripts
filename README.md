# Rigo's Synthesizer V Scripts

## Introductions

### Copy parameters along with notes

This script does exactly what the name indicates. Notice that when a dialog box is popped up, you're not allowed to control the editor. So the script has to wait until you navigate your playhead to the destination where you want to paste. You can set the timeout and make the script keep waiting if you're not done with it in one shot.

### Fine tune BPM

When you're making a cover of a song, it might have a strange tempo that doesn't round down to an integer BPM. Now with this script you can use this script to align up the bar lines with the audio waveform with ease. You can select a tempo marker and click a button, the script can add or subtract down to 0.01 BPM to the tempo marker. You can continue to adjust it to your liking without opening the script window after each operation.
