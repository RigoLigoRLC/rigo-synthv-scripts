# Rigo's Synthesizer V Scripts

## Introductions

### Copy parameters along with notes

This script does exactly what the name indicates. Notice that when a dialog box is popped up, you're not allowed to control the editor. So the script has to wait until you navigate your playhead to the destination where you want to paste. You can set the timeout and make the script keep waiting if you're not done with it in one shot.
